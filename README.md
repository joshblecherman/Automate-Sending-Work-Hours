When this code is run, it will prompt the user for the relevant month, and the pay period. 
The pay period is either the 1st - 15th, or the 16th through the end of the month. 
It will then read a file containing ones work hours, in the following example format: 
December
1 1hr
4 3hr
16 2 hr 
January
1 1hr 

This means that in December, you worked 1 hour on the first, 3 hours on the 4th, 2 hours on the 16th, etc. 

If I were to improve this project in the future, I would:
1. have the information pay period info read from the command line as opposed to python input 
2. Perhaps have it completely automated so it sends by itself at the end of every pay period
